# Prevalence and Evolution of MDR *Klebsiella pneumoniae* in Peru 🇵🇪

## Overview
This repository contains the analysis for a Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis evaluating antimicrobial resistance (AMR) trends of K. pneumoniae in Peruvian hospitals (2003–2021). We analyzed 2,210 clinical isolates to determine the prevalence of resistance to third-generation cephalosporins (3GC).

## Key Findings
Pooled Resistance: 68.0% resistance to 3GC among isolates.
Temporal Trend: Resistance increased significantly from ~40% in 2003 to over 70% in 2021.
Drivers: A strong and statistically significant correlation was found between ESBL prevalence and 3GC resistance (p < 0.0001).

## Repository Structure
* `data.csv`: Aggregated study-level data (Author, Year, Sample Size, Resistance).
* `analysis.qmd`: R/Quarto script for meta-analysis and visualization (Forest and Funnel plots).
